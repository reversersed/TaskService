### Template

If you have make installed, you can:
- run `make i` to install all project dependencies, and then run `make run` to regenerate documentation and rebuild the project
- or just run `make start` to build project without installing dependencies and build existing pre-generated files

Neither, if you dont have make installed, you can build and run the project with `docker compose --env-file ./config/.env up --build -d` command

<h4>Make sure you have Docker started before building and starting project</h4>

After project started you can open `localhost:9000/swagger/index.html` (with default confing) in browser to see OpenAPI swagger documentation.<br>
